Table that shows you browser compatibility with ES6+
https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/

+ originally, you were stuck with "var", but now there's "let"
+ "const" is used to make immutable variables

+ Using String Templates like this:
console.log("Hello", firstName);
This will add spaces between words so: "Hello tom" is what will be output
+ Using String Templates with `` is MUCH better because it'll actually grab new lines as well:
    console.log(`Hi ${firstName}! Thanks!
        Total: $${price}
        Shipping: $${shipping}
        Grand Total: $${price + shipping}`)
NOTE: It'll grab those tabs as well, so be aware
